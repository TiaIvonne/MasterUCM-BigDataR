Modeling process for Data-Driven competition: Pump it Up, Data Mining the Water Table.<br>

Using data from a specific data set in the data-driven repository, I need to predict whether or not the water pump will be functional.

First, start with basic modeling only with numerical columns for prediction with random forest algorithm and then with more complex columns, including data transformation and visualizing tools. And last, write some conclusions from data set modeling and changes in each model (3 in total)
